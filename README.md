## to-do

1. replace visitors cmd w/ stats cmd that outputs site stats
* 1. total commits
* 2. repo size
* 3. updated
2. add projects command that opens new draggable/resizable/closable window w nested tabs for different kinds of projects
* 1. similar to toggle js on nohat.tv/2lagv2, but all in 1 instead of separate
* 2. add so when closed, sends output txt send console saying (Projects closed.) or something
3. ... profit?
